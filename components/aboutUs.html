                    <h2>Are you ready to enjoy some rich history of the Church?</h2>
                </div>
                <p>In 1952, some members of the non-teaching staff of the University who were Presbyterians and Methodists started meeting for Sunday church service in their various homes on a rotational basis. In the early 1960s, when the number of worshippers increased, they moved into one of the classrooms at the Weweso Local Authority School (currently Weweso Metropolitan Assembly School). The Church was then known as the United Church, but most of the hymns sung were Presbyterian hymns, and the Service Order followed was mainly Presbyterian. The Church Services were conducted in the vernacular. The Catechist-in-Charge was Mr. S. Alema-Mensah, a Presbyterian. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the Church did not have a Minister, it relied on the services of Ministers from Ramseyer Congregation of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, Adum, Kumasi, during Communion Services. Some of the Ministers were Rev. P. C. Richter, Rev. G. K. Sintim-Misa, Rev. E. M. L. Odjidja and Rev. H. O. Ansah, all Presbyterian Ministers. Rev. P. C. Richter and Rev. G. K. Sintim-Misa later became Protestant Chaplains of the University.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rev. P. C. Richter officiated the first Joint Presbyterian/Methodist Church baptism on December 5, 1953. All communicants were issued Presbyterian Membership cards in which tithes and other entries were made.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1961, the Chaplain of the University, Rev. G. K. Sintim-Misa, decided to rename the United Church, which initially met at the Weweso School, as the UST Protestant Vernacular Church most probably to differentiate it from the Protestant Congregation, which met elsewhere on campus and conducted services in English.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, the Church moved to the University Community Centre. After some time, the place was unsuitable for church services. The Methodists, amongst them, later moved out to join the Ayigya Methodist Church. The remaining Presbyterians appealed to the University authorities, specifically the then Vice-Chancellor, Dr. R. P. Baffour, to allocate a plot of land in the University to them to build a chapel. A plot of land opposite the Weweso School, which now hosts the BRRI flats, was allocated to them to build a chapel. The worshippers declined the offer because it was too close to the Kumasi-Accra highway, which posed a threat to their lives and those of their dependents.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Congregation, therefore, sought permission from the authorities of the UST Primary School to worship in their Assembly Hall on Sundays. The Church service started there when Mrs. Agnes Opoku was the Headmistress.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the Presbyterians worshipped at the UST Primary School, frantic efforts were made to start a Church building in the mid-1970s. The sod-cutting for the commencement of the Church building was done in 1976 during the tenure of Rev. D. B. O. Rockson. He was then a Methodist minister and the Protestant Chaplain of the University, while Prof. E. Bamfo Kwakye was the Vice Chancellor of UST.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other Protestant Chaplains who were Presbyterians, including Rev. D. A. Koranteng (who later became Moderator of the Synod of PCG), Rev. Dr. Sam Prempeh (who later became Moderator of the Synod of PCG) and Rev. Dr. K. Effa-Ababio at various times, encouraged the Protestant to complete the Church building and start the Church Hall. Later, other Presbyterian Ministers who came to pastor the KNUST Presbyterian Church at various times, namely Rev. G. K. Acheampong, Rev. Kwadwo Owusu-Sarpong and Rev. J. H. Ofosuhene, also encouraged the Congregation to complete the Church building project.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the mid-1990s, the Church members took a bold step to move into the new chapel even though it was not completed. The worshippers used palm fronds as covering over the chapel. It was a strategy adopted to spur the congregants to provide funds for the permanent roofing of the chapel. The roofing began on March 25, 1991, and was completed by April 4, 1991.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1993, the Church became a fully-fledged Presbyterian Church, and the first Presbyterian Session was constituted after elections were held in the new chapel. Since then, the Church has assumed a complete Presbyterian identity, and all its activities have followed the order of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, the Church introduced the first Youth Service from 6:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. However, because of low patronage, it was abrogated.The Church introduced the English service scheduled for 7:00am to 9:00am in [YEAR]. In 2021, the Session re-introduced the Youth Service.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of the worshippers kept growing so fast after the church moved to the Weweso School that the Presbyterian Church requested the use of the Community Centre for church services on Sundays. After some time the Community Centre was found to be unsuitable for use on Sundays for church service. The Community Centre was used as an entertainment spot virtually every Saturday evening, with programmes, at times, ending in the early hours of Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In August 2009, the Congregation named the Church "CHRIST CONGREGATION, KNUST, KUMASI". A special service officiated jointly by Rev. Dr. G. O. Lartey and Rev. Dr. Kwabena Opuni-Frimpong was held to commemorate the event.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    On February 12, 2012, Christ Congregation, KNUST, which had been under Kumasi District for all this while, was elevated to a District status as TEK District in the Asante Presbytery, with Rev. Prof. Charles Ansah as the first acting District Minister. In August 2014, Rev. Herbert Anim-Opong was posted to the TEK District as the District Minister and Minister-in-Charge of Christ Congregation, KNUST.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 23rd May 2015, a special prayer session was conducted to commence work on Church complex at Asokore Mampong. A stone laying and profiling was done at the project site. The prayer service was conducted by Rev. Prof. Charles Ansah, the acting Minister and the profiling team led by the project architect, Dr. Rexford Assasie Oppong. A preaching point was established at Asokore Mampong and officially commenced worship on 12th July 2015 in a temporary structure erected on site.

            <h2>The Chapel</h2>
           </div>
           <p style="padding-top: 15px;">Following the sod-cutting for the chapel in 1976, the Presbyterians and Anglicans through annual harvests and other fund-raising activities continued to build the chapel. In 1990 the Presbyterians took a bold decisopn to worship in the new chapel even though it was not roofed. Palm fronds were used to shelter the worshippers from the sun. It was a strategy adopted to spur the congregation on to provide funds for the permanent roofing of the chapel.  A quantity of long-span aluminium roofing sheets was ordered from Tema. On 25th March 1991, the roofing of the chapel began and by 4th April 1991, it was completed.  The congregation moved to the present premises after the roofing was completed.</p>
           <p style="padding-top: 10px;">By dint of hard work and tenacity of purpose, the congregation pressed on and completed the construction of the church.  Furniture for the church (pews) were provided individually and together as a congregation.</p>

The Christ Congregation has supported the conference with financial support and other logistics. Members of the Congregation have worked assiduously in the background to ensure the success of these conferences.  The church also organises health services for the members of conference during these times.
                <br>
                It is envisaged that the New District would continue to service the Annual Conference and make them more successful in the years to come.
                    The congregation acknowledges the spiritual and financial support it receives from the National Ministers' Conference.
