        <h3>History of KNUST Christ Congregation</h3>
      </div>

        <div class="history-container">
                <p>Big things have small beginnings”; so is The Presbyterian Church of Ghana, KNUST Christ Congregation. According to oral accounts given by some pioneers and now-retired staff of the then Kumasi College of Technology and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, including Mr. S. Alema-Mensah, Mr. S.A.K. Kwakye and Mr. and Mrs. E.K. Opoku, the origins of the KNUST Presbyterian Church date back to 1954.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1954, some of the members of the non-teaching staff of the University, especially those in the Hall Six area, who were Presbyterians and Methodists started a church service in the Twi language and decided to meet every Sunday. Because they did not have a spacious meeting place the families met in their individual homes to worship the Lord. Later they decided to rotate the meeting places for services among the families. A family, thus, hosted a church service each Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is on record that a church service, conducted in English, had been started somewhere on campus a year earlier to take care of the spiritual needs of the staff and students. The oversight responsibility of that congregation was given to one E.R.P. Duchwath Esq., designated as Dean. The Church hymnal was used during the services. The first baptism officiated by E.R.P. Duchwath Esq. took place on 8th March, 1953.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the early 1960s, when the number of worshippers increased considerably and no family could accommodate all the congregants, the families jointly took a decision to get a bigger meeting place where they could all meet to worship the Lord. They eventually got a meeting place in one of the classrooms at the Weweso Local Authority School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pioneer worshippers at the Weweso School included the following Presbyterians; Mr. S. Alema-Mensah, Mr. E.K.Opoku, Mrs. Alice Opoku, Mr. & Mrs. Kwayisi, Mr. S.A.K. Kwakye, Mr. & Mrs. J.K. Hagan, Mr. Okai Mensah, Mr. Amofa, Mad. Comfort Gyambibi, Mr. Takyi and wife, Mr. J.K. Nortey, Mr. Asare, Miss Yeboah, Mad. Christiana Ababio, Mrs. Felicia Pabbi, Mr. Fleischer-Djoleto, Mr. E. K. Okine and wife.  The few Methodists were Mr. & Mrs. Odoom, Mr. Turkson, and Mr. E. K. Bortey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Presbyterians and the Methodists worshipped together at Weweso. The church was then known as the United Church but the hymns sang during church services were, however, Presbyterian hymns. The Presbyterian Order of Service was followed and the Church Service was conducted in Twi. The Catechist-in-Charge of the congregation was Mr. S. Alema-Mensah, a Presbyterian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the church which met at Weweso did not have any Minister in charge, it relied on the services of Ministers from Ramseyer Presbyterian Church, Adum - Kumasi to pastor it. During communion days, those Reverend Ministers were invited to officiate. They included Rev. P.C. Richter and Rev. G.K. Sintim-Misa, who both later became the Protestant Chaplains of the University. Others were Rev. E.M.L. Odjidja and Rev. H.O. Ansah both Presbyterian Ministers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is on record that the first baptism of the joint Presbyterian-Methodist church officiated by the Rev. P.C. Richter took place on 15th December, 1953. All the communicants then were issued with Presbyterian Membership Cards in which tithe entries were made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two Chaplains who were Presbyterian Ministers continued to have oversight responsibility of the church at the Weweso School. Other preachers from the Methodist church were occasionally invited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was one of the Chaplains by name Rev.G.K. Sintim-Misa, who in 1961 decided to designate the United Church, which initially met at the Weweso School, as the Protestant Church (Vernacular) most probably to differentiate it from the congregation which met elsewhere on campus and conducted services in English.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the Methodists had moved out and joined the Ayigya Methodist Church, an appeal was made to the University authorities, specifically, the then Vice-Chancellor, Dr. R.P. Baffour, by the remaining Presbyterians to allocate a plot of land for the building of a chapel. A plot of land opposite the Weweso School and at the place which now sites the tall BRRI flats was allocated for the building of a chapel. Unfortunately, the worshippers declined the offer and rather wanted a change of plot for the simple reason that it was too close to the main Kumasi-Accra highway and therefore posed a threat to their lives and those of their dependants. Later another plot allocation was made at the present site of the Protestant church building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of the worshippers kept growing so fast after the church moved to the Weweso School that the Presbyterian Church requested the use of the Community Centre for church services on Sundays. After some time the Community Centre was found to be unsuitable for use on Sundays for church service. The Community Centre was used as an entertainment spot virtually every Saturday evening, with programmes, at times, ending in the early hours of Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was very inconvenient for the Presbyterians to worship there because the youth had to put the place in order before service on Sundays. That was a very daunting task for the youth. In view of the inconvenience another request was made to the authorities of the KNUST Primary School to allow the Presbyterians worship there on Sundays. This was granted and for a long time the Presbyterian Church worshipped there when Mrs. Agnes Opoku was the Headmistress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the Presbyterians were worshipping at the KNUST Primary School frantic efforts were made to start the church building in the mid-70s. The sod-cutting was done in 1976 during the term of the then Protestant Chaplain, Rev. D.B.O. Rockson, who was a Methodist Minister. He encouraged the staffs who were Methodists to continue to worship at the Ayigya Church thereby leaving the Presbyterians to mobilize funds to put up the chapel building. Other Protestant Chaplains, who were Presbyterians, including Rev. D.A. Koranteng, Rev. Sam Prempeh and Rev. K. Effa-Ababio, at various times, supported the Presbyterians and Anglicans to complete the church building and start the Church Hall. Other Presbyterian Ministers who came to pastor the KNUST Presbyterian church at various times, namely Rev.G.K. Acheampong, Rev. Kwadwo Owusu-Sarpong, and Rev. J.H. Ofosuhene, also encouraged the congregation to complete the church building project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Presbyterians and the Anglicans jointly raised funds to build the chapel through annual Harvests and other fund-raising activities. The two churches have made other monetary contributions to the building of the chapel and the Church Hall which are currently being jointly used by the two churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The church became a full Presbyterian Church around 1993 when the first Presbyterian Session was constituted after elections were held in the new Chapel.  Since that time the church assumed a true Presbyterian flavour and all its activities have followed the order of the church.

           <div class="chapel">
            <h2>The Chapel</h2>
           </div>
           <p style="padding-top: 15px;">Following the sod-cutting for the chapel in 1976, the Presbyterians and Anglicans through annual harvests and other fund-raising activities continued to build the chapel. In 1990 the Presbyterians took a bold decisopn to worship in the new chapel even though it was not roofed. Palm fronds were used to shelter the worshippers from the sun. It was a strategy adopted to spur the congregation on to provide funds for the permanent roofing of the chapel.  A quantity of long-span aluminium roofing sheets was ordered from Tema. On 25th March 1991, the roofing of the chapel began and by 4th April 1991, it was completed.  The congregation moved to the present premises after the roofing was completed.</p>
           <p style="padding-top: 10px;">By dint of hard work and tenacity of purpose, the congregation pressed on and completed the construction of the church.  Furniture for the church (pews) were provided individually and together as a congregation.</p>

          <p style="padding-top: 15px;">In 2009, the congregation agreed to name the church "CHRIST CONGREGATION, KNUST, KUMASI".  A special service to officially announce the new name was held. It was officiated jointly by Rev. Dr. G.O.Lartey and Rev. Dr. K. Opuni-Frimpong.</p>
